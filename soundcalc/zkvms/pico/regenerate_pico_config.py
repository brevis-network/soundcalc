"""Regenerates pico.toml from Pico's soundness manifest.

Pico writes `mle-core/tests/soundness_manifest.json` from a keygen of its production circuits
(`cargo run --release -p pico-vm --example mle_soundness_manifest`); its CI checks the file
against the code. This script reads it at the commit `PICO_COMMIT`, checks that the circuits
there are tag v3.1.1's, scores the configuration with soundcalc against the manifest, and only
then writes pico.toml. Regenerate the reports afterwards with `python3 -m soundcalc`.

Usage, from the repository root:
    python3 soundcalc/zkvms/pico/regenerate_pico_config.py [--pico-dir PATH]

`--pico-dir` reads both manifests from a local Pico checkout (`git show`) instead of GitHub.

# which Pico writes from a keygen of its production circuits and checks in CI. Do not edit;
# regenerate with
#   python3 soundcalc/zkvms/pico/regenerate_pico_config.py && python3 -m soundcalc
# The script checks that the manifest's keys, shapes, parameters and scores are those of tag
# v3.1.1 ({PICO_V311}).
# Since v3.1.1 Pico has added a pure-execution mode (brevis-network/pico#126) and the
# proof-shape records used below (brevis-network/pico#131); neither changes a key.
#
# Proof chain: RISCV -> CONVERT -> COMBINE -> COMPRESS -> EMBED -> WRAP / Groth16. DEFERRED, on the
# side, verifies the root proof of each program whose proof the guest verifies.
# COMPRESS is the final proof, through which Pico targets 128 bits. EMBED re-proves it under a
# BN254 transcript for the on-chain Groth16 step, which is held to BN254's security level; it is
# listed before COMPRESS because soundcalc takes the last circuit as the final proof.
#
# Shapes: recursion proofs are verified only under whitelisted keys, and each recursion circuit
# fixes, as constants of its key, which child AIRs are present and how tall they are. COMPRESS's
# own key fixes its shape: each of its AIRs is required and preprocessed, and the verifier holds a
# preprocessed trace's height to the key. Every proof in the chain therefore has one of finitely
# many shapes, COMPRESS and EMBED one each. The shape inputs of each circuit are the maxima over
# the shapes its whitelist-mode proofs take; the proof_size_* inputs are those of the largest of
# them, whose encoded size the model then gives exactly, except for the bytes the encoding spends
# on absent AIRs (riscv). Digests are encoded in 32 bytes: eight 32-bit KoalaBear words, or one
# BN254 element for EMBED.
#
# Soundness: the raw totals equal Pico's own calculator. On the same protocol Pico's calculator
# charges two terms more conservatively, neither of them binding: GKR sumcheck at 4 events per
# sub-round instead of 3 (0.415 bits lower) and GKR batching at 2 events per round instead of 1
# (1 bit lower). Three non-binding terms are higher here because they use the whitelist's shapes
# where Pico's calculator takes the worst case a key admits: constraint batching (Pico takes the
# GKR depth at 0; every whitelist-mode proof's GKR is at least as deep as its tallest trace),
# stacked reduction and WHIR mu batching (the widest shape's columns and stacked width).
